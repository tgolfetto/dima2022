## DIMA 2022: A mobile app for in-store clothing shopping

DIMA 2022 is an Android app designed to enhance the shopping experience for customers and clothing store sales staff. It offers a range of features to streamline the shopping process and improve customer satisfaction. The app was developed as a university project for the "Design and Implementation of Mobile Application" course at the Polytechnic University of Milan.

## Key Features:
- **Customer Login:** Customers can create an account to save their preferences and access personal orders.
- **Employee Login:** Store employees can log in to assist customers, and track store traffic.
- **Product Information:** Customers can scan a tag or code attached to a clothing item to access detailed product information, including descriptions, sizes, colors, and availability.
- **Size/Color Requests:** Customers can request a different size or color of an item directly from the fitting room. The request is sent to the nearest sales associate's app, ensuring prompt assistance.
- **Location Tracking:** The app tracks the customer's location within the store, providing valuable data for analyzing customer behavior and optimizing store layout.

## Benefits:
- **Enhanced Customer Experience:** Customers can find product information quickly, request assistance easily, and enjoy a more personalized shopping experience.
- **Improved Sales Efficiency:** Sales staff can receive customer requests promptly, assist customers efficiently, and track inventory levels more effectively.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Store managers can gain valuable insights into customer behavior and store traffic patterns, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## Technologies:
- **Built with Flutter:** Flutter is an open-source framework from Google that allows you to build beautiful, fast, and native-feeling apps for mobile (Android & iOS), web, desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), and even embedded devices. This means the app you're using can run smoothly on a variety of platforms with a single codebase.
- **Powered by Firebase:** Firebase is a back-end development platform from Google that provides services like databases, user authentication, cloud storage, and analytics.  In this case, Firebase acts as the brain of the app, handling data storage and user management. The structure of the database can be found [HERE](dima2022-491c4-default-rtdb-export.json). Note that most of the data has been deleted, the file attached has to be considered for structural purposes only.

Overall, DIMA 2022 offers a comprehensive solution for enhancing the shopping experience in clothing stores, benefiting both customers and businesses.
